This blog is my notes about how to conduct a digital communication system simulation in Matlab. My Matlab version is R2023a. Two textbooks that I recommend here is *Digital Communications* by Proakis and *Wireless Communication Systems in Matlab* by Mathuranathan Viswanathan. You can also follow the MIT open course [Principle of Digital Communication](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-451-principles-of-digital-communication-ii-spring-2005/pages/readings-and-lecture-notes/).
