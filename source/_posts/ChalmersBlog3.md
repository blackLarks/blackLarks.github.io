I love shopping in Swedish supermarkets. Beyond just filling my stomach, I enjoy experiencing the unique shopping process and often find intriguing things along the way. Let me share some highlights with you!

## **The Dairy Dilemma**

The first time I bought milk and yogurt in Sweden, I was overwhelmed by the endless options in the chilled section. Here's a quick illustration:

Imagine stepping into a Swedish supermarket for the first time and facing rows of neatly arranged milk cartons—how would you choose? For me, it felt like picking my destiny: colorful yet utterly confusing. After this supermarket visit, I sought advice from a Swedish classmate at Chalmers University, who happens to study [Chemistry](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/chem/). With a touch of humour, he said, "Well, in a way, it *is* chemistry," before explaining the lineup:

- **Lätt Mild Yoghurt Vanilj**: Low-fat vanilla yogurt.
- **A-fil Naturell**: Traditional fermented yogurt, plain and unsweetened—very sour!
- **Yoggi Original Vanilj**: Original vanilla yogurt.
- **30% Mindre Socker Mild Yoghurt Mango**: Low-sugar mango yogurt.
- **Filmjölk** **Hallon/Blåbär**: Fermented milk with raspberry and blueberry flavor.
- **Laktos Fri Mellanmjölk**: Lactose-free milk with 1.5% fat.
- **Filmjölk Original**: Original fermented milk.

I wish I knew his "professional chemistry info" before my first supermarket visit! Because at that day, I intended to buy **Mellanmjölk** but ended up with **A-fil Naturell** instead. When I poured it out at home, I realized they were not the same "chemical composition." Now that you’ve read my blog, if you ever come to Sweden, you’ll know which dairy product suits you best!

Curious about this vibrant dairy culture, I did some research and found that Sweden’s agricultural heritage and focus on healthy eating have led to this diversity. Fermented dairy products like **Filmjölk** were historically developed to preserve milk. Sweden’s milk consumption is among the highest globally, second only to Finland.

**Filmjölk**, one of Sweden’s most traditional dairy products, resembles "soured milk" but with its own unique twist. To me, it has a flowing yet subtly aged sourness. Introduced to the market by Swedish dairy cooperative [Arla](https://web.archive.org/web/20070702073632/http:/www.arlafoods.se/templates/PlainPage2.aspx?id=6530) in 1931, it holds a special place in Swedish food history.

Maybe you are coming to Sweden, please imagine what it feels like to have ten kinds of dairy products to choose from for breakfast! Which one are you curious about the most?

## Restocking Your Fridge

Beyond the dairy products I just mentioned, you’ll need to stock up on more "survival essentials" to keep your fridge well-equipped. Shopping in Gothenburg is a breeze—supermarkets are practically everywhere!

Here’s a pro tip: check the weekly discount flyers from each supermarket and plan your shopping accordingly. I see this as a culture of being prepared for opportunities.

A few months ago, before I came here, I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to find rice and noodles that suit the Chinese palate. However, after arriving, I realized my concerns were unnecessary. Nearly all local supermarkets—especially Asian markets—sell a variety of flavourful and reasonably priced rice. Additionally, I can find a wide range of noodles, such as spaghetti, alkaline noodles, and more.

As an [Information and Communication Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/find-masters-programme/information-and-communication-technology-msc/) student at Chalmers, I often feel like products are sending me "buy me!" signals. However, with limited fridge space as a solo dweller, I stick to essentials unless discounts tempt me into a "shopping trap."

## Black Friday

Apart from filling up your fridge, you might find yourself needing to pick up some household appliances, clothes, or other essentials—and let’s not forget the temptation of online shopping! As it happens, I recently braved Sweden’s Black Friday sales, so let me take you on a little journey through that fun (and slightly chaotic) experience!

Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, marks the official start of the Christmas shopping season and is known as the craziest shopping day of the year. Gothenburg is no exception. I am currently in Norstan - the busiest city centre in Gothenburg during Black Friday. Let me show you the bustling scene! Watch out for the bustling crowds, but don't miss the exciting discounts!

Back in China, I’d heard of Black Friday’s shopping frenzy but experiencing it in Sweden’s vibrant mall atmosphere gave me new perspective. Curious about its origins, I found that the term "Black Friday" was first used in Philadelphia to describe the traffic chaos caused by shoppers. Later, the name took on a financial meaning, as businesses recorded profits in "black" ink and losses in "red".

To be honest, when I first arrived in Gothenburg, I didn’t even own a bowl. Every meal I ate came straight out of my 28cm wok. That trusty wok handled everything from reheating food to frying meat and even making soup. To save it from a work-life imbalance, I got it a companion this Black Friday: a 28cm frying pan! Of course, I also treated my cabinet to a few sets of bowls and plates. All these treasures were acquired through the magic of online shopping. If you enjoy cooking, you absolutely need a microwave oven, an induction cooker, and some pots. Black Friday is the perfect time to grab these essentials. This reflects how globalization and modern conveniences allow even a shop-heavy country like Sweden to embrace at-home deliveries.

One of the perks of being a student is getting access to amazing discounts! On this [website](https://mecenat.com/se), you can log in as a student and unlock big savings on everything from public transportation to daily shopping at various brands. And at Black Friday, the discounts will be even bigger!

All you need is a Chalmer mecenat card. It’s like having a secret pass to great deals!

If you come to Chalmers for study and when you arrive in Gothenburg，which supermarkets would you check out? What gadgets or essentials would you add to your student apartment? Feel free to drop me a comment or shoot me your questions—I’d love to hear from you!
